/*
Though system() is not safe, we will still do it this way. The command has two parts. 
Part one checks for the ffmpeg version. And part two has two subparts. First we redirect 
any output (from the stdout) to /dev/null. Dev contains device files that are connected. 
dev/null is a pseudo device file. So we are redirecting the output to nowhere. 
Next there are three streams : input file stream (0), output file stream (1) and error stream (2). 

We also want to redirect the error stream to the output stream which is already redirected 
to the nowhere place. Therefore doing this allows this command to execute and not produce 
any output. The return value of system() is the exit code of the process. 
Zero means success and anything else means failure.
